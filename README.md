## 🏗️ Architecture

### Page Object Model (POM)
The project implements the Page Object Model pattern for maintainable and reusable code:

```typescript
// Example: LoginPage.ts
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}
  
  async login(username: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.fill('[data-test="username"]', username);
    await this.page.fill('[data-test="password"]', password);
    await this.page.click('[data-test="login-button"]');
  }
}
```

### Test Fixtures
Centralized test setup and teardown logic in `tests/fixtures.ts`:
- Pre-authenticated user sessions
- Test data management
- Common test utilities
- Browser context configuration

---

## 🔧 Development

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **ESLint**: Code linting and formatting
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting

### Best Practices
- Page Object Model implementation
- Proper wait strategies and locators
- Environment-based configuration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed test documentation

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in `tests/` directory
2. Implement corresponding Page Object if needed
3. Add test to appropriate test suite
4. Update documentation

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`):

- **Automated testing** on push/PR to main branches
- **Multi-browser execution** in parallel
- **Artifact preservation** (reports, screenshots, videos)
- **Failure notifications** and detailed reporting

### Pipeline Features
- Node.js environment setup
- Dependency caching
- Playwright browser installation
- Test execution with retries
- Report artifact upload (30-day retention)
